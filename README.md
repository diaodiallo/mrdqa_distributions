## Overview
## Requirements
The following minimum requirements need to be met for both the mobile application and DHIS2 metadata package;
* Android version 10 and above
* DHIS2 version 2.35 and above
## Installation
### Mobile Application
The android mobile application installer is distributed as an APK (Android Package Kit) available on the this git repository. In the future, we plan to distribute this APK through Google Play Store as it provides so many security measures. The instructions below work from Android version 11 and above.
1.  Download the APK version you want to install.
2.  Navigate to your Download folder using a file browser app or simply begin the install by clicking on the completed download in your mobile browser.
3.  Android will ask you to grant permission to either the file browser or your web browser to install the app. Grant the permission and it should redirect you back to the installation screen. If not, navigate back to your Download folder after granting the permission to try again.
4. The app should be safely installed.
### Metadata Package
The <a href="https://github.com/diaodiallo/mdqa_dhis_package">metadata package</a> is a pre-configured template of DHIS2 metadata that can be installed on standalone instance or integrated into a country or organization's existing DHIS2. The process of installing a metadata package is well documented and can be found <a href="https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/metadata/immunization/immunization-aggregate/installation.html">here</a>
## Configuring the Mobile Application
After installing the application and the DHIS2 package you can use the mobile application user guide to do the necessary configurations for supervisions.
